            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Plot Reviv'd:</hi> OR A MEMORIAL OF THE LATE AND PRESENT POPISH PLOTS, Publiſhed to refreſh the Memories of all undepraved <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and thereby prevent the Ruine of this Nation, by disbelieving, or forgetting of them.</head>
            <p>Firſt, THe Burning of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1666; by which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> (by Plunder in the time of the Fire) got 13000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> declaro,</hi> which they brought into their Treaſury, for carrying on of their Satanical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; the Truth of which is proved by that moſt worthy and deſerving perſon Dr. <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> to whom, and to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> next under God, and our King, we owe our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Burning of <hi>Southwark,</hi> by which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> got, in the ſame way as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 3000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to bring into their Treaſury; as is alſo proved by Dr. <hi>Oates;</hi> whoſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtands authentick and un-impeached, maugre the Attempts of the wicked Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Adherents, for the invalidating of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Burning of St. <hi>Katherines</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is proved by that Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his King and Countrey, Capt. <hi>Bedloe;</hi> and all theſe are perpetrated by them, as previous, and in order to their Grand and Helliſh Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Murder of the King, the Introducing of Popery, and Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and conſequently the Maſſacring of (at leaſt) the Chief and Heads of the Proteſtants; without which, they could not promiſe to themſelves the effecting of their Deſign: And the Truth of this hath been ſufficiently made out at the ſeveral Trials of the ſeveral perſons that have been Executed for the ſame; and with ſo much Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth hereof to his Majeſty, that he hath, Firſt, Owned his Belief of it, by ſeveral Proclamations; giving the Plot the true Epithetes of Helliſh and Damnable; and Secondly, By his appointing throughout the Land a Day of Humiliation in Faſting and Praying, upon the Occaſion of the Diſcovery hereof; all which may well lay an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Duty upon all good Subjects, not to queſtion the Truth of his Proclamations, which are alſo ſeconded by the Judgment of two ſeveral Parliaments, who after Hearing of Witneſſes, Voted their full ſatisfaction of the Truth of theſe Infernal Popiſh Plots; And however Parliaments may be miſtaken in other things, thoſe that know the Method
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51139:2"/>of Parliamentary Proceedings, muſt hold it almoſt morally impoſſible for them, to fail in Matter of Fact, becauſe being compoſed of perſons of ſeveral Humors, Affections and Judgments, a Vote for Matter of Fact cannot paſs, untill every one hath received a clear Anſwer and Satisfaction unto his Objections. And I never heard that there was ſo much as one Negative to the Truth of this not to be parallell'd grand Plot; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the whole, the Verity of it ought not to be doubted, or called in queſtion. And now,</p>
            <div type="parts">
               <head>The Wayes which have been uſed by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle the Credit of theſe Diſcoveries, and to bring the Truth of them into Queſtion, are fit to be remembred; being as followeth.</head>
               <p>Firſt, By Barbarouſly Murdering of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> becauſe, he having taken the Examinations concerning the Plot, which they knew he carried about with him, they might ſeize them (as they did) and ſo as they preſumed, put a Disbelief upon the Plot; but God in his Mercy preſerving the chief Witneſs (who they intended to have ſent after Sir <hi>Edmond.</hi>) hath turned the Murder of this Gentleman upon their own heads, in a Diſadvantage to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By endeavouring to bring Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> to deny the Truth of what he had confeſſed upon Oath, concerning the Murder of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, By employing one <hi>Reading</hi> a Barriſter at Law, to ſuborn Capt. <hi>Bedlo,</hi> to deny the Truth of what he had upon Oath confeſſed; of which ſubornation of Perjury, the ſaid <hi>Reading</hi> was found guilty in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and for his Crime therein, Condemned in the penalty of 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to lie in priſon a year; and after that, until he pays his Fine, and to ſtand in the Pilory (as he hath done) before <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> and at his Trial, it appeared that the Lords in the Tower, committed for the Grand Plot, did employ him, promiſing both him and Capt. <hi>Bedlo</hi> great Rewards; but his Years of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment being now expired, or near upon, his Fine, as is hoped by his Relations, will be remitted, and he ſet at liberty; which I mention to the end to Caution all men to take heed of him, and let his vile and vexatious Carriage to the Countrey-People in the Northern Level be a Warning to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By Suborning, <hi>Knox, Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osburn,</hi> to Invalidate the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> by Indicting him of moſt Inormous Crimes, for which the two firſt (the third being run away) were found Guilty, in the Court of Kings Bench of Subornation of Perjury, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in ſeveral Fines, to lie a Year in Priſon after that, untill they pay their Fines, and <hi>Lane,</hi> to ſtand in the Pillory. <hi>Knox</hi> was Servant to the Lord <hi>Latimore,</hi> and <hi>Dunblain,</hi> or to one of them, both Sons to <hi>Thomas Osburn</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, By Imploying Mr. <hi>Taisbrough,</hi> (then Servant to a Perſon of Quality) and one Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> to Suborn Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> to Recant and Deny the Evidence he had given upon Oath againſt the Lords <hi>Stafford,</hi> and <hi>Aſton,</hi> for Conſpiring the death of his Majeſty, with promiſes of great reward for ſo doing, of which Subornation of Perjury, they are found Guilty in the Court of Kings Bench, and are this Term to receive their Sentence, which is hoped, will be adequeate to the odiouſneſs of their Crimes, for if this trade of Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſuffered to go on, no man can be ſafe, Innocency being no defence.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, By Imploying Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> to kill my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and make the Meal Tub Plot, with deſigns moſt Wickedly, and Unjuſtly, to Father it upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to the end, to render them (though Innocent) as Vile and Deteſtable as themſelves, who cannot be parallelled by any on this ſide Hell, except the by ſome of their own Church, for which the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> were all Committed to ſeveral Priſons for <hi>High-Treaſon:</hi> and this Plot appears to have been hatched
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51139:2"/>in the Tower, and cariyed on by the Lords there, according to (their chief Agent in the buſineſs) Mr. <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Narrative, for the Impeached Lords, having liberty to come to one another and to have whom they pleaſe come to them, they do little beſide Contriving one Plot after another.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the attempting the Murther of Mr: <hi>Mowbray,</hi> a chief Witneſs againſt Sr. <hi>Thomas Caſcoin,</hi> and the reſt of the Conſult in the North, for Killing of the King (though the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not diſcovered) may reaſonably be reckoned to proceed from the ſame Fountain as the reſt.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The Witneſs brought from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> who by the Confeſſion of ſome of themſelves, were (in giving their Evidence) to follow the Directions they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive here, from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who ſent for them, and lodged them in the forementioned Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe, had all of them the ill luck to be detected in Court of great Forgery, at the Tryal of their Friends, the Prieſts and Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The endeavours of Mr. <hi>Jenniſons</hi> Friends to bring him to deny what he hath diſcovered Concerning the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> appears by the ſeveral Letters Writ to him by his Brother the Jeſuit, and others, which are recited in Mr. <hi>Jenniſons</hi> Narrative.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Their preſent Conſpiracy for Maſſacring, and (to enrich themſelves) Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the City of <hi>London,</hi> is the Maſter Piece of their Father the Devil; but yet wherein they Glory moſt God is above them, and though they will not ſee, he will make them ſee, and be aſhamed of their Malice and Hatred againſt his People.</p>
               <p>Their drawing in a few Ignorant, Debauched Apprentices to colour their Miſchievous Devices, ſhew more the Malice and Hatred of their Hearts, than ſtrength of their Brains, for though there may be ſome leud Fellows amongſt them, there cannot be enough to do their abominable drugery, they being in the general of ſober education, and as we at leaſt haters of their damnable Intentions, and their Policy in giving their preſent Contrivance the name of the Apprentices Plot, is eaſily ſeen through hope, For.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They do it, to keep the odium of it off themſelves, and according to their uſual Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to thruſt it upon the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> as had the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot</hi> taken effect, they were in thoſe days, provided of St. <hi>Omer</hi>-like Witneſſes, to have proved that they did it in their own defence, to prevent a Maſſacre of them, which was intended by the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> as alſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day are ſo Impudent, that I have heard ſome of them affirm, that the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a Maſſacre of them by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and not of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſurely never any Heathens, or Infidels, made Lies their Refuge like to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, knowing that Popery cannot be brought into <hi>England,</hi> where the light of the Goſpel ſhines ſo clear, without Arbitrary Government, and that cannot be introduced without ruining of the City, they call the Plot after the Name of the Apprentices, to this end, that when they have deſtroyed the King, they may make the Government of the City, not being able to keep the Citizens in peace, a pretence for taking away the Charter of it, and thence to rule it for the future by a Governor, with a Garriſon, after their own will and pleaſure, which would be a more effectual way for deſtroying of <hi>London,</hi> than the burning of it; for the loſs by Fire, may be recovered by Trade, but the loſs of Trade, by the loſs of Liberty is irreparable, and this Plot, like the reſt, appears by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, to have been forged in the Tower, and carried on by the Lords that are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners init.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, The Papiſts late, moſt inhumane, bruitiſh, and worſe than Beaſtly uſage of Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> in the many wounds they moſt cruelly and maliciouſly gave him, beſide Butcher-like cutting of his Throat with a Knife, after they had by men employed to that purpoſe, knocked him down in a by Lane, at 10 a Clock at Night, to prevent his Information the next Day againſt them, is another demonſtration of their murtherous and bloody Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and the miraculous eſcape and recovery of this Gentleman, ought to be reckoned with the reſt of the merciful Providences of God towards us, and as an earneſt of his ſpecial protection, and that he who hath delivered us, will ſtill deliver us, as alſo a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, to have a watchful Eye upon the Papiſts, whoſe Mercies are Cruelties.</p>
               <p>The Burning of the Temple, the ſeveral Fires in <hi>London,</hi> the deſign Three or Four years agoe for burning the Market Towns in <hi>Hartfordſhire; Durance</hi> endeavouring ſubornation of perjury againſt Sr. <hi>Rob. Payton,</hi> I omit it, as not being ſo Authentickly proved as the reſt, though under violent preſumption, that they all derive their Original from one and the ſame Fountain, the whiſling inſignificant <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and the reſt of the Papiſts.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51139:3"/>
               <p>And now upon the whole it may be obſerved; Firſt, that theſe ſeveral ſubornations of Perjurie, with the other contrivances plotted againſt the Blood, Life, and Eſtates of the Innocents, in Fathering High Treſon upon them, are clear demonſtrations of guilt in the Papiſts, as to all theſe Plots, for that it cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed that faultleſs perſons, eſpecially of their quality, would intereſt themſelves in ſuch wicked, odious, and diſgraceful deſigns, as the worſt and meaneſt of mortal Men would abhor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the aſſaulting the fidelity of the Kings Evidence with temptations of great rewards (which they rejected) is a full proof; Firſt, of the integrity of the Evidence. Secondly, that the Papiſts know nothing to invalid their Teſtimony by; otherwiſe, they would not have had recourſe to the diſhonourable way of Bribery. And thirdly, That the Reproaches the Papiſts endeavour to caſt upon them, are not to be believed, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from malicious and implacable Enemies, deſtitute of all Honour or Honeſty, whoſe ſlanderous practiſes are but according to the Doctrine of their Church towards any that oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Papiſts Induſtry in endeavouring unjuſtly to Father one Plot after another upon the Proteſtants, wherein they have ſtill been detected, is a ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Innocency and Loyalty of the Proteſtants, and of the Sordid, Deviliſh and Inhumane Deſigns of the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>And Fourthly, If after His Majeſties Proclamations, declaring the Damnableneſs of the Popiſh Plots, His appointing upon the occaſion of them, a Day of Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and two ſeveral Parliaments agreeing with the King in Voting the ſame, any ſhall dare to Queſtion the Truth of them, they ought, and may with great reaſon, be judged private, if they are not publick profeſſed Papiſts, or men void of Common Sence and Reaſon.</p>
